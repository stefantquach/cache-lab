# Cache lab
This was written for CSE361S: Introduction to System Software at Washington University
in St. Louis. The bulk of this project was creating a cache simulator, which indicates the number of hits, misses, evictions, and dirty evictions, given the specific parameters of the cache and for a specific trace file.

Below is the original documentation given during the assigment.
```
This is the handout directory for the CS:APP Cache Lab.

************************
Running the autograders:
************************

Before running the autograders, compile your code:
    linux> make

Check the correctness of your simulator:
    linux> ./test-csim

Check the correctness and performance of your transpose functions:
    linux> ./test-trans -M 32 -N 32
    linux> ./test-trans -M 64 -N 64
    linux> ./test-trans -M 61 -N 67

Check everything at once (this is the program that your instructor runs):
    linux> ./driver.py
